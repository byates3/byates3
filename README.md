Hello! My name is Beau Yates, and I'm a film and computer science student at the University of Notre Dame.

**About me**:
I am a rising senior at Notre Dame with a major in Film, Television, and Theatre, and a minor in Computing and Digital Technologies. I am passionate in film, animation, VFX, and music, and I hope to work with creative focused technology in the themed entertainment or film industries.

**Technical skills**: 
Coding Languages:
- Python
- MATLAB
- MEL

VFX and Film Softwares:
- MAYA
- Houdini
- Davinci Resolve
- Adobe Premier Pro

**Current Projects**:
1. Skyrim Book Streamlit App
2. Named Entity Recognition Streamlit App
3. Creating Tidy Data From Mutant Moneyball Dataframe Streamlit App
4. Penguin Exploration Streamlit App

**Goals**
I have particularly enjoyed exploring natural language processing and named entity recognition using spaCy. In the future, I hope to continue Python projects exploring the capabilities of NER. I also hope to apply my skills and experiences in Python coding to the topic of 3D animation. Whether it is creating tools in Houdini or coding an animated sequence in Maya, I will continue to work on projects that push me closer to my dreams as a themed entertainment designer or producer.
